    <p>A batsman of breathtaking chutzpah and enterprise. A cricketer with overflowing talent and the temperament to back it up.
         A fielder able to leap tall buildings and still come up with the catch - and who will happily move behind the stumps into the wicketkeeper's spot if needed.
         A fine rugby player, golfer, and tennis player. AB de Villiers has emerged as one of South Africa's greats.</p><br>
        <p>De Villiers is a 360-degree batsman who can hit any ball, anywhere, against any bowler. Indeed, his range of inventive shots has grown as his career has unfolded.
             He has been ranked among the top Test and ODI batsmen in the world and has established a cult-like following in T20 cricket,
             where his performances in the IPL have earned him a legion of Indian fans.</p></div>

            Having played both as an opener and as a lower-order wicketkeeper/batsman in his first Test series, he soon proved his worth by amassing 460 runs in his first away tour to the Caribbean Islands in 2005. A slump in form ensued - de Villiers battled for runs against Australia both at home and away - 
            he had to wait until the home series against West Indies in 2007-08 to again reach the three-figure mark. However, he made up for the lost time, spanking a fine 217 against India in Ahmedabad, the first South African player to hit a double ton against India.

            It was plain sailing later on for the flamboyant right-hander as he scored runs for fun. It included a superb unbeaten 278 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in November 2010, briefly placing him at the top of the ladder for the  
            highest individual score by a South African batsman before Amla's 311* at the Oval less than a year later.

        What would have been the Indian Premier League if not for the presence of South Africa's Superman, AB de Villiers? The 360 degree batsman is a crowd favourite - not just at the M Chinnaswamy stadium, but anywhere across the cricketing world. One of the few players who has been part of the extravaganza, right from its inception in 2008, 
        it was only when he joined the Royal Challengers - ahead of the 2011 edition, that he truly became a fan favourite.</p>

        AB de Villiers has proved that each and every penny spent on him has been money well spent - both on the field and off-field. A crowd-puller, AB combined with India's captain, Virat Kohli, to lead RCB's challenge. He finished as the leading run-getter for his franchise for three seasons and was a constant name in the top-three run-scorers, ever since joining in 2011. While his versatility made him one of the best bats - across all formats of the game, his mere presence has come as a shot in the arm for RCB - who are still in search for their maiden IPL title.
